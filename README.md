# leetcode-solutions

This repository is a compilation of my LeetCode solutions. I solved these problems on my own and did not originally intend to publish them publicly on GitHub. My focus was on learning rather than producing a polished, finished work product. As a result, the code ranges from highly polished solutions to rough drafts, including files with commented-out blocks of code.

Please note that I uploaded many of these solutions retrospectively. Thus, some represent problems I've solved recently while others represent attempts from years ago.

These solutions represent my own work, and I believe I am free to share them as my own intellectual property. Where necessary, I have also included portions of the “skeleton” code that LeetCode provides to give context for each problem. For IP reasons, I have not included the full problem descriptions.

I believe this falls under “fair use,” but if you have any copyright or IP infringement concerns, please contact me.

:warning: :construction: Heads up: Creating this repo involved a lot of copy-paste work and terminal commands, so some of the file names may be wrong. I'm working on fixing this.
